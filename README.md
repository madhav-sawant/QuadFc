# QuadFC - ESP32 Based Flight Controller

A custom flight controller firmware built from scratch on ESP32. Inspired by Betaflight and ArduPilot, but designed for learning and experimentation.

**Status:** Angle mode flight tested (Control loops active, tuning in progress). Future updates in progress.

## About

This project started as a way to understand how drones actually work under the hood. Instead of using off-the-shelf flight controllers, I decided to build the firmware myself on an ESP32.

The goal was to replicate what Betaflight and ArduPilot do, but at a smaller and more accessible level. This isn't meant for commercial use - it's purely for learning, experimenting, and tinkering.

## Important Note on PID Values

This setup has **high mechanical gain** because of the 1400KV motors with 8045 props. That's why the PID values in this firmware are relatively low.

If you watch YouTube tutorials (like Joop Brokking or Carbon Aeronautics) where people use much higher PID values, it's because their mechanical gain is different (smaller props, lower KV motors, etc).

If you want easier tuning with lower mechanical gain:
- Use 1000KV motors
- Use 8045 props (10-inch)
- Same F450 frame

Also note: This firmware is written in **pure C** using the ESP-IDF framework, not Arduino C++.

Motor positions (Quad-X, props-out):

   M4(CCW)──────M2(CW)      FRONT
       ╲      ╱
         ╲  ╱

## How to Build and Flash

You'll need PlatformIO installed (VS Code extension works great).

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/madhav-sawant/QuadFC.git
cd QuadFC

# Build and upload
pio run --target upload

# Open serial monitor
pio device monitor
```

---

## Calibration

Before first flight, you need to calibrate the accelerometer:

1. Place the drone on a flat, level surface
2. Hold the BOOT button while powering on
3. Keep holding until the LED starts blinking
4. Release the button and wait for calibration to complete
5. Done - calibration is saved permanently

---

## How to Arm and Fly

1. Power on the drone and keep it still (gyro calibrates automatically)
2. Make sure throttle is at minimum
3. Flip the arm switch (Channel 5) to HIGH
4. LED turns solid - drone is armed
5. Slowly raise throttle and fly

To disarm, flip the arm switch back to LOW.

**Key Points:**
- **Complementary Filter** combines Accelerometer + Gyroscope to get stable angle
- **Angle Loop** compares pilot's target angle with current angle → outputs target rotation rate
- **Rate Loop** compares target rate with actual gyro rate (direct from sensor) → outputs motor corrections
- **Mixer** combines throttle + corrections → individual motor speeds

The system uses a cascaded control structure:
- Outer loop (Angle) - maintains the desired tilt angle
- Inner loop (Rate) - handles fast stabilization using gyro data

### Sensor Fusion: Complementary Filter

The IMU (MPU6050) has two sensors that measure orientation:

| Sensor | What it measures | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|--------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Accelerometer | Gravity direction | No drift, knows absolute "down" | Noisy, affected by vibrations |
| Gyroscope | Rotation rate | Fast, smooth, ignores vibrations | Drifts over time |

A **Complementary Filter** combines both to get the best of each:

```
new_angle = α × (old_angle + gyro × dt) + (1-α) × accel_angle
```

Where `α = 0.996` (99.6% gyro, 0.4% accelerometer)

- **Short-term (fast changes):** Trust gyroscope (smooth, responsive)
- **Long-term (slow corrections):** Trust accelerometer (prevents drift)

This gives us fast response without gyro drift - essential for stable flight.

## Safety Features

| What | When it triggers | What happens |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| Crash detection | Angle > 90° or Gyro > 2000°/s | Motors shut off |
| RX failsafe | No signal for 200ms | Motors shut off |
| Emergency stop | BOOT button pressed | Motors shut off immediately |
| Arm safety | Throttle not at zero | Won't arm |
| Low battery | Voltage < 10.5V | LED blinks warning |
